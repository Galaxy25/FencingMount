# Overview

A updated school project made with Fusion 360. It was designed to mount a fencing sabre for practice without the need of screws

## Installation

1. Superglue the hand and mount together.

2. Slip the clamp between the base and table brim. I recommend placing a towel between them to avoid scraping

3. Unscrew blade and push it through the holes.

4. Wrap the blade shield back onto the bolt and secure it firmly.
